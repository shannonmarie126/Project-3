**Rent vs. Mortgage: A Data-Driven Comparison Across the USA**

Presented by: Luis Arroyo, ​Shannon Young, ​Bhavya Jayaprakash, ​Allison Mccollum.

## The Purpose of the analysis ##

The objective is to analyze and compare rent and mortgage prices across the United States from 2020 to 2024.

1 . What trends do the rents and mortgages have in common?​

2 . How have those trends changed  in the five years studied?​

3 . Which states show the highest/lowest rates?

## Resources ##
Zillow API​
Choropleth Leaflet plug in​
Chart.JS

# Analysis #

Users can engage with the project by hovering over individual states on the interactive maps to view corresponding rent and mortgage data. Additionally, the dropdown menu provides a more detailed exploration of housing costs within each state.

In curating this dataset, we carefully considered several ethical implications. These include affordability versus accessibility, ensuring that comparisons do not mislead renters into believing homeownership is universally attainable; data representation and bias, striving for a dataset that accurately reflects regional, economic, and demographic diversity; gentrification and displacement concerns, recognizing that rising property values may contribute to the displacement of long-term residents; and potential misuse by financial and real estate entities, acknowledging the risk of selective data interpretation that could serve institutional interests over consumer well-being.

We obtained our dataset from Zillow (www.zillow.com); we used the choropleth plugin in order to create the maps.

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, our analysis highlights that the decision between renting and buying is highly dependent on multiple factors. Based on the interactive map, the trend between rent vs mortgage can be studied based on individual needs and circumstances. There is no universally correct answer—rather, the best choice depends on factors carefully analyzed and studied through the years.
