# Project-3

The objective of this project is to analyze and compare rent and mortgage prices across the United States from 2020 to 2024.

Users can engage with the project by hovering over individual states on the interactive maps to view corresponding rent and mortgage data. Additionally, the dropdown menu provides a more detailed exploration of housing costs within each state.

In curating this dataset, we carefully considered several ethical implications. These include affordability versus accessibility, ensuring that comparisons do not mislead renters into believing homeownership is universally attainable; data representation and bias, striving for a dataset that accurately reflects regional, economic, and demographic diversity; gentrification and displacement concerns, recognizing that rising property values may contribute to the displacement of long-term residents; and potential misuse by financial and real estate entities, acknowledging the risk of selective data interpretation that could serve institutional interests over consumer well-being.

We obtained our dataset from Zillow (www.zillow.com); we used the chlorpleth plugin in order to create the maps.
